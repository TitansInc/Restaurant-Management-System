Existing System<br>
In the existing system only we can see <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD10">the details</span>
 of particular information about the police stations in our state, the 
existing system has more workload for the authorized person, but in the 
case of Proposed System, the user can registered in our site and send 
the crimereport and complaint about a particular city or person.<br>
Drawbacks of Existing System<br>
&gt;	More man power.<br>
&gt;	Time consuming.<br>
&gt;	Consumes large volume of pare work.<br>
&gt;	Needs manual <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD8">calculations</span>.<br>
&gt;	No direct role for the higher officials.<br>
&gt;	Damage of machines due to lack of attention.<br>
To avoid all these limitations and make the working more accurately the system needs to be computerized.<br>
Proposed System<br>
The aim of proposed system is to develop a system of improved 
facilities. The proposed system can overcome all the limitations of the 
existing system. The system provides proper security and reduces the 
manual work. The existing system has several disadvantages and many more

reduce these difficulties up to some extent. The proposed system will 
help the user to reduce the workload and mental conflict. The proposed 
system helps the user to work user friendly and he can easily do his 
jobs without time lagging.<br>
Expected Advantages of Proposed System<br>
The system is very simple in design and to implement. The system 
requires very low system resources and the system will work in almost 
all configurations. It has got following features<br>
&gt;	Ensure data accuracy's.<br>
&gt;	Proper control of the higher officials.<br>
&gt;	Reduce the damages of the machines.<br>
&gt;	Minimize manual data entry.<br>

INPUT DESIGN<br>
The input design is the link between the information system and the 
user. It comprises the developing specification and procedures for data 
preparation and those steps are necessary to put transaction data in to a
 usable form for processing can be achieved by inspecting the computer 
to read data from a written or printed document or it can occur by 
having people keying the data directly into the system. The design of 
input focuses on controlling the amount of input required, controlling 
the errors, avoiding delay, avoiding extra steps and keeping the process
 simple. The input is designed in such a way so that it provides 
security and ease of use with retaining the privacy. Input Design 
considered the following things:<br>
S	What data should be given as input<br>
S	How the data should be arranged or coded<br>
S	The dialog to guide the operating personnel in providing input.<br>
S	Methods for preparing input validations and steps to follow when error occur.<br>
OBJECTIVES<br>
&gt;	Input Design is the process of converting a user-oriented 
description of the input into a computer-based system. This design is 
important to avoid errors in the data input process and show the correct
 direction to the management for getting correct information from the 
computerized system.<br>
&gt;	It is achieved by creating user-friendly screens for the data entry
 to handle large volume of data. The goal of designing input is to make 
data entry easier and to be free from errors. The data entry screen is 
designed in such a way that all the data manipulates can be performed. 
It also provides record viewing facilities.<br>
&gt;	When the data is entered it will check for its validity. Data can 
be entered with the help of screens. Appropriate messages are provided 
as when needed so that the user will not be in maize of instant. Thus 
the objective of input design is to create an input layout that is easy 
to follow<br>
OUTPUT DESIGN<br>
A quality output is one, which meets the requirements of the end user 
and presents the information clearly. In any system results of 
processing are communicated to the users and to other system through 
outputs. In output design it is determined how the information is to be 
displaced for immediate need and also the hard copy output. It is the 
most important and direct source information to the user. Efficient and 
intelligent output design improves the system's relationship to help 
user decision-making.<br>
	Designing computer output should proceed in an organized, well thought 
out manner; the right output must be developed while ensuring that each 
output element is designed so that people will find the system can use 
easily and effectively. When analysis design computer output, they 
should Identify the specific output that is needed to meet the 
requirements.<br>
	Select methods for presenting information.<br>
	Create document, report, or other formats that contain information produced by the system.<br>
The output form of an information system should accomplish one or more of the following objectives.<br>
o Convey information about past activities, current status or projections of the Future.<br>
o Signal important events, opportunities, problems, or warnings. o Trigger an action. o Confirm an action.<br>

3. Introduction</span><br>
                              System analysis is a process of gathering 
and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and the information to 
recommend improvements on the system. It is a problem solving activity 
that requires intensive communication between the system users and 
system developers. System analysis or study is an important phase of any
 system development process. The system is studied to the minutest 
detail and analyzed. The system analyst plays the role of the 
interrogator and dwells deep into the working of the present system. The
 system is viewed as a whole and the input to the system are identified.
 The outputs from the organizations are traced to the various processes.
 System analysis is concerned with becoming aware of the problem, 
identifying the relevant and decisional variables, analyzing and 
synthesizing the various factors and determining an optimal or at least a
 satisfactory solution or program of action.<br>
               A detailed study of the process must be made by various 
techniques like interviews, questionnaires etc. The data collected by 
these sources must be scrutinized to arrive to a conclusion. The 
conclusion is an understanding of how the system functions. This system 
is called the existing system. Now the existing system is subjected to 
close study and problem areas are identified. The designer now functions
 as a problem solver and tries to sort out the difficulties that the 
enterprise faces. The solutions are given as proposals. The proposal is 
then weighed with the existing system analytically and the best one is 
selected. The proposal is presented to the user for an endorsement by 
the user. The proposal is reviewed on user request and suitable changes 
are made. This is loop that ends as soon as the user is satisfied with 
proposal. <br>
              Preliminary study is the process of gathering and 
interpreting facts, using the information for further studies on the 
system. Preliminary study is problem solving activity that requires 
intensive communication between the system users and system developers. 
It does various feasibility studies. In these studies a rough figure of 
the system activities can be obtained, from which the decision about the
 strategies to be followed for effective system study and analysis can 
be taken. <br>
        Here in the Email to Fax server project, a detailed study of 
existing system is carried along with all the steps in system analysis. 
An idea for creating a better project was carried and the next steps 
were followed. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3.1 Existing System</span><br>
 In the existing system only we can see the details of particular 
information about the police stations in our state, the existing system 
has more workload for the authorized person, but in the case of Proposed
 System, the user can registered in our site and send the crimereport 
and complaint about a particular city or person. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  3.2 Drawbacks of Existing System</span><br>
	More man power.<br>
	Time consuming.<br>
	Consumes large volume of pare work.<br>
	Needs manual calculations.<br>
	No direct role for the higher officials.<br>
	Damage of machines due to lack of attention.<br>
To avoid all these limitations and make the working more accurately the system needs to be computerized.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3.3 Proposed System</span><br>
The aim of proposed system is to develop a system of improved 
facilities. The proposed system can overcome all the limitations of the 
existing system. The system provides proper security and reduces the 
manual work. The existing system has several disadvantages and many more
 difficulties to work well. The proposed system tries to eliminate or 
reduce these difficulties up to some extent. The proposed system will 
help the user to reduce the workload and mental conflict. The proposed 
system helps the user to work user friendly and he can easily do his 
jobs without time lagging.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
           <br>
        3.4 Expected Advantages of Proposed System<br>
</span><br>
	The system is very simple in design and to implement. The system 
requires very low system resources and the system will work in almost 
all configurations. It has got following features <br>
	Ensure data accuracy’s.<br>
	Proper control of the higher officials.<br>
	Reduce the damages of the machines.<br>
	Minimize manual data entry.<br>
	Minimum time needed for the various processing.<br>
	Greater efficiency.<br>
	Better service.<br>
	User friendliness and interactive.<br>
	Minimum time required.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3.4.1 FEASIBILITY STUDY<br>
	</span><br>
Feasibility study is made to see if the project on completion will serve
 the purpose of the organization for the amount of work, effort and the 
time that spend on it. Feasibility study lets the developer foresee the 
future of the project and the usefulness. A feasibility study of a 
system proposal is according to its workability, which is the impact on 
the organization, ability to meet their user needs and effective use of 
resources. Thus when a new application is proposed it normally goes 
through a feasibility study before it is approved for development.<br>
<br>
           The document provide the feasibility of the project that is 
being designed and lists various areas that were considered very 
carefully during the feasibility study of this project such as 
Technical, Economic and Operational feasibilities. The following are its
 features:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
 3.4.2 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY<br>
</span><br>
           The system must be evaluated from the technical point of view
 first. The assessment of this feasibility must be based on an outline 
design of the system requirement in the terms of input, output, programs
 and procedures. Having identified an outline system, the investigation 
must go on to suggest the type of equipment, required method developing 
the system, of running the system once it has been designed.<br>
Technical issues raised during the investigation are:<br>
<br>
	Does the existing technology sufficient for the suggested one?<br>
	Can the system expand if developed?<br>
<br>
              The project should be developed such that the necessary 
functions and performance are achieved within the constraints. The 
project is developed within latest technology. Through the technology 
may become obsolete after some period of time, due to the fact that 
never version of same software supports older versions, the system may 
still be used. So there are minimal constraints involved with this 
project. The system has been developed using Java the project is 
technically feasible for development.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3.4.3 ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY</span><br>
<br>
           The developing system must be justified by cost and benefit. 
Criteria to ensure that effort is concentrated on project, which will 
give best, return at the earliest. One of the factors, which affect the 
development of a new system, is the cost it would require.<br>
          The following are some of the important financial questions asked during preliminary investigation: <br>
<br>
	The costs conduct a full system investigation.<br>
	The cost of the hardware and software.<br>
	The benefits in the form of reduced costs or fewer costly errors.<br>
<br>
     Since the system is developed as part of project work, there is no 
manual cost to spend for the proposed system. Also all the resources are
 already available, it give an indication of the system is economically 
possible for development.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3.4.4 BEHAVIORAL FEASIBILITY</span><br>
This includes the following questions:<br>
	Is there sufficient support for the users?<br>
	Will the proposed system cause harm?<br>
     <br>
       The project would be beneficial because it satisfies the 
objectives when developed and installed. All behavioral aspects are 
considered carefully and conclude that the project is behaviorally 
feasible.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
     4. Introduction<br>
</span><br>
          Design is the first step into the development phase for any 
engineered product or system. Design is a creative process. A good 
design is the key to effective system. The term “design” is defined as 
“the process of applying various techniques and principles for the 
purpose of defining a process or a system in sufficient detail to permit
 its physical realization”. It may be defined as a process of applying 
various techniques and principles for the purpose of defining a device, a
 process or a system in sufficient detail to permit its physical 
realization. Software design sits at the technical kernel of the 
software engineering process and is applied regardless of the 
development paradigm that is used. The system design develops the 
architectural detail required to build a system or product. As in the 
case of any systematic approach, this software too has undergone the 
best possible design phase fine tuning all efficiency, performance and 
accuracy levels. The design phase is a transition from a user oriented 
document to a document to the programmers or database personnel. System 
design goes through two phases of development: Logical and Physical 
Design.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
4.1 LOGICAL DESIGN:<br>
</span><br>
            The logical flow of a system and define the boundaries of a system. It includes the following steps:<br>
	Reviews the current physical system – its data flows, file content, volumes ,   Frequencies etc.<br>
	Prepares output specifications – that is, determines the format, content and Frequency of reports.<br>
	Prepares input specifications – format, content and most of the input functions.<br>
	Prepares edit, security and control specifications.<br>
	Specifies the implementation plan.<br>
	Prepares a logical design walk through of the information flow, output, input, Controls and implementation plan.<br>
	Reviews benefits, costs, target dates and system constraints.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
4.2 PHYSICAL DESIGN:</span><br>
<br>
     Physical system produces the working systems by define the design 
specifications that tell the programmers exactly what the candidate 
system must do. It includes the following steps.<br>
<br>
	Design the physical system.<br>
	Specify input and output media.<br>
	Design the database and specify backup procedures.<br>
	Design physical information flow through the system and a physical design   <br>
	Plan system implementation.<br>
	Prepare a conversion schedule and target date.<br>
	Determine training procedures, courses and timetable.<br>
	Devise a test and implementation plan and specify any new hardware/software.<br>
	Update benefits , costs , conversion date and system constraints<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Design/Specification activities:<br>
</span><br>
	Concept formulation.<br>
	Problem understanding.<br>
	High level requirements proposals.<br>
	Feasibility study.<br>
	Requirements engineering.<br>
	Architectural design.<br>

4.4 INPUT DESIGN</span><br>
                   The input design is the link between the information 
system and the user. It comprises the developing specification and 
procedures for data preparation and those steps are necessary to put 
transaction data in to a usable form for processing can be achieved by 
inspecting the computer to read data from a written or printed document 
or it can occur by having people keying the data directly into the 
system. The design of input focuses on controlling the amount of input 
required, controlling the errors, avoiding delay, avoiding extra steps 
and keeping the process simple. The input is designed in such a way so 
that it provides security and ease of use with retaining the privacy. 
Input Design considered the following things:<br>
	What data should be given as input?<br>
	How the data should be arranged or coded?<br>
	The dialog to guide the operating personnel in providing input.<br>
	Methods for preparing input validations and steps to follow when error occur.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
OBJECTIVES<br>
</span><br>
	Input Design is the process of converting a user-oriented description 
of the input into a computer-based system. This design is important to 
avoid errors in the data input process and show the correct direction to
 the management for getting correct information from the computerized 
system.<br>
	It is achieved by creating user-friendly screens for the data entry to
 handle large volume of data. The goal of designing input is to make 
data entry easier and to be free from errors. The data entry screen is 
designed in such a way that all the data manipulates can be performed. 
It also provides record viewing facilities.<br>
	When the data is entered it will check for its validity. Data can be 
entered with the help of screens. Appropriate messages are provided as 
when needed so that the user will not be in maize of instant. Thus the 
objective of input design is to create an input layout that is easy to 
follow<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
4.5 OUTPUT DESIGN </span><br>
                         A quality output is one, which meets the 
requirements of the end user and presents the information clearly. In 
any system results of processing are communicated to the users and to 
other system through outputs. In output design it is determined how the 
information is to be displaced for immediate need and also the hard copy
 output. It is the most important and direct source information to the 
user. Efficient and intelligent output design improves the system’s 
relationship to help user decision-making.<br>
<br>
•	Designing computer output should proceed in an organized, well thought
 out manner; the right output must be developed while ensuring that each
 output element is designed so that people will find the system can use 
easily and effectively. When analysis design computer output, they 
should Identify the specific output that is needed to meet the 
requirements.<br>
•	Select methods for presenting information.<br>
•	Create document, report, or other formats that contain information produced by the system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
     The output form of an information system should accomplish one or more of the following objectives.<br>
o	Convey information about past activities, current status or projections of the                Future.<br>
o	Signal important events, opportunities, problems, or warnings.<br>
o	Trigger an action.<br>
o	Confirm an action.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
DATABASE DESIGN</span><br>
                        A database is an organized mechanism that has 
the capability of storing information through which a user can retrieve 
stored information in an effective and efficient manner. The data is the
 purpose of any database and must be protected.<br>
<br>
                  The database design is a two level process. In the 
first step, user requirements are gathered together and a database is 
designed which will meet these requirements as clearly as possible. This
 step is called Information Level Design and it is taken independent of 
any individual DBMS.<br>
            In the second step, this Information level design is 
transferred into a design for the specific DBMS that will be used to 
implement the system in question. This step is called Physical Level 
Design, concerned with the characteristics of the specific DBMS that 
will be used. A database design runs parallel with the system design. 
The organization of the data in the database is aimed to achieve the 
following two major objectives.<br>
o	Data Integrity<br>
o	Data independence<br>
         Normalization is the process of decomposing the attributes in 
an application, which results in a set of tables with very simple 
structure. The purpose of normalization is to make tables as simple as 
possible. Normalization is carried out in this system for the following 
reasons.<br>
	To structure the data so that there is no repetition of data , this helps in    <br>
                     saving.  <br>
	To permit simple retrieval of data in response to query and report request.<br>
	To simplify the maintenance of the data through updates, insertions, <br>
                     Deletions.<br>
	To reduce the need to restructure or reorganize data which new application<br>
                     Requirements arise.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          <br>
4.7.1 RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS):<br>
</span><br>
                    A relational model represents the database as a 
collection of relations. Each relation resembles a table of values or 
file of records. In formal relational model terminology, a row is called
 a tuple, a column header is called an attribute and the table is called
 a relation. A relational database consists of a collection of tables, 
each of which is assigned a unique name. A row in a tale represents a 
set of related values.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
RELATIONS, DOMAINS &amp; ATTRIBUTES:</span><br>
        A table is a relation. The rows in a table are called tuples. A 
tuple is an ordered set of n elements. Columns are referred to as 
attributes. Relationships have been set between every table in the 
database. This ensures both Referential and Entity Relationship 
Integrity. A domain D is a set of atomic values. A common method of 
specifying a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values
 forming the domain are drawn. It is also useful to specify a name for 
the domain to help in interpreting its values. Every value in a relation
 is atomic, that is not decomposable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
RELATIONSHIPS:</span><br>
o	Table relationships are established using Key. The two main keys of 
prime importance are Primary Key &amp; Foreign Key. Entity Integrity and
 Referential Integrity Relationships can be established with these keys.<br>
o	Entity Integrity enforces that no Primary Key can have null values.<br>
o	Referential Integrity enforces that no Primary Key can have null values.<br>
o	Referential Integrity for each distinct Foreign Key value, there must 
exist a matching Primary Key value in the same domain. Other key are 
Super Key and Candidate Keys.<br>
o	Relationships have been set between every table in the database. This 
ensures both Referential and Entity Relationship Integrity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
NORMALIZATION:</span><br>
               As the name implies, it denoted putting things in the 
normal form. The application developer via normalization tries to 
achieve a sensible organization of data into proper tables and columns 
and where names can be easily correlated to the data by the user. 
Normalization eliminates repeating groups at data and thereby avoids 
data redundancy which proves to be a great burden on the computer 
resources. These includes:<br>
<br>
	Normalize the data.<br>
	Choose proper names for the tables and columns.<br>
	Choose the proper name for the data.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
First Normal Form:</span><br>
         The First Normal Form states that the domain of an attribute 
must include only atomic values and that the value of any attribute in a
 tuple must be a single value from the domain of that attribute. In 
other words 1NF disallows “relations within relations” or “relations as 
attribute values within tuples”. The only attribute values permitted by 
1NF are single atomic or indivisible values.<br>
      The first step is to put the data into First Normal Form. This can
 be donor by moving data into separate tables where the data is of 
similar type in each table. Each table is given a Primary Key or Foreign
 Key as per requirement of the project. In this we form new relations 
for each nonatomic attribute or nested relation. This eliminated 
repeating groups of data.<br>
     A relation is said to be in first normal form if only if it satisfies the constraints that contain the primary key only.<br>
Second Normal Form:<br>
          According to Second Normal Form, for relations where primary 
key contains multiple attributes, no nonkey attribute should be 
functionally dependent on a part of the primary key. <br>
         In this we decompose and setup a new relation for each partial 
key with its dependent attributes. Make sure to keep a relation with the
 original primary key and any attributes that are fully functionally 
dependent on it. This step helps in taking out data that is only 
dependant on apart of the key.<br>
<br>
     A relation is said to be in second normal form if and only if it 
satisfies all the first normal form conditions for the primary key and 
every non-primary key attributes of the relation is fully dependent on 
its primary key alone.<br>
Third Normal Form:<br>
            According to Third Normal Form, Relation should not have a 
nonkey attribute functionally determined by another nonkey attribute or 
by a set of nonkey attributes. That is, there should be no transitive 
dependency on the primary key.<br>
     In this we decompose and set up relation that includes the nonkey 
attributes that functionally determines other nonkey attributes. This 
step is taken to get rid of anything that does not depend entirely on 
the Primary Key.<br>
    A relation is said to be in third normal form if only if it is in 
second normal form and more over the non key attributes of the relation 
should not be depend on other non key attribute.<br>
